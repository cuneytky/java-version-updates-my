        Strings
Strings in Java are internally represented by a char[] containing the characters
of the String, and every char is made up of 2 bytes because Java internally uses
UTF-16
Strings typically usually occupy a large proportion of the JVM heap space.
Because of the way they are stored by the JVM, in most cases, a String instance
can take double space it actually needs
        Compact Strings
New Compact String, recently introduced in Java9, is designed to optimize
memory consumption of Strings on the JVM.
Whenever we create a String if all the characters of the String can be
represented using a byte ,LATIN-1 representation, a byte array will be used
internally. In other cases, if any character requires more than 8-bits to represent
it, all the characters are stored using two bytes for each, UTF-16 representation
